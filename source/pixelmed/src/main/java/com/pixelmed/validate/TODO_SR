- template inclusion - propagate relationship from inclusion to content

- template inclusion - support type UC (may only be present if)

- root template - check that invokeroottemplate only invokes those with root flag and converse for includetemplate

- check in source at compile time that supplied value types and relationships are legitimate

- should compare coding scheme versions, not just cv and csd when comparing codes

- would be nice to check (sanitized) versions of code meanings and warn if different

- when checking value set CID, should make use of baseline, defined or enumerated flags

- would be nice to allow context groups to recursively include other context groups

- would be nice to check laterality requirement for paired or not as permissable by anatomic location

- need to check parameters for templates, including context groups

- for mandatory text content items, should check not zero length

- would be nice to force check of RI, blood glucose, incubation period, based on modality perhaps ?

- check unitsCID

- check conceptNameCID

- need to update CID 5000 three letter codes against "http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/English_list.php"

- need to support in CID 5000 compound lanaguage-country as per RFC3006 (by separating string components before performing lookup)
