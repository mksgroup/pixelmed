This ZIP file contains the 12 ECG test records for SCP compression/decompression.
The 12 files contains pure ECG data. 
Before testing SCP implementation demographic data (e.g. patient identification,
date/time of acquisition) must be added. 


Describtion of the data format of the ECG data
-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
- Each file contains 5000 samples * 8 leads * 2 bytes/sample = 80000 bytes.
- Signed 16 bit per sample
- The ECG data are stored in sample order.
- The data are recorded at 500Hz; the sample interval is 2ms.
- The amplitude value multilpier for these data is 1 µV/LSB.
- The included 8 leads are: I, II, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 and V6.
- The least significant byte is transmitted first, the most significant byte last.
  (little-endian byte order)
