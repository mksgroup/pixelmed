# Application.SleepTimeBetweenPassesToProcessReceivedFiles in seconds
#
# An interval of 10 minutes (600 seconds) or so is probably appropriate

# without finding anything new

#
# Application.IntervalAfterLastInstanceReceivedToWaitBeforeProcessingStudy in seconds
#
# This is how long to wait between when new instances have been received
# for a study, before processing it; i.e., a heuristic substitute for
# explicit notification that a study is "complete"; once this interval has
# passed and a study has been processed (to find dose files), it will not
# be processed again. 
#
# An interval of 2 hours (7200 seconds) is suggested as a reasonable compromise
# in a production environment between when all work on a study is likely to be
# complete, and not waiting too long to process it; that said, there is no rush
# to send anything to the registry, so this interval could be (much) longer
#
# One could wait days, as long as the database is not cleared, since the work
# will hang around indefinitely once files have been retrieved, and is not
# affected by the number of days to query (DaysBackwardsFromTodayToQuery). The
# size of the database, and particularly the saved instance files, will be
# influenced by how long work is left unprocessed.

# Application.SleepTimeBetweenPassesToQueryRemoteAEs in seconds

# This is how long to wait between queries to the remote AEs (usually the PACS)
# to retrieve more work). 
#
# An interval of 2 hours (7200 seconds) is suggested as a reasonable compromise
# in a production environment since one does not want to burden the PACS without
# reason with an excessive number of queries; note that each query is for an
# entire days work, so the responses will get larger as the day progresses, and
# querying fmore frequently will NOT reduce the size of the response each time
#
# There is a potential interaction with the value specified for the
# IntervalAfterLastInstanceReceivedToWaitBeforeProcessingStudy, since if a query
# is performed by chance when a study is only partially present in the PACS, it
# may get processed and flagged as completed and never to be revisited again. So
# ideally, the sleep between queries plus the processing time for all the work
# (unpredicable) would be less than the interval to wait before processing.
